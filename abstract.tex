This document shows the required format and appearance of a manuscript prepared for SPIE journals. It is prepared using LaTeX2e with the class file \texttt{spieman.cls}. The abstract should consist of a single paragraph containing no more than 200 words. It should be a summary of the paper and not an introduction. Because the abstract may be used in abstracting and indexing databases, it should be self-contained (that is, no numerical references) and substantive in nature, presenting concisely the objectives, methodology used, results obtained, and their significance. A list of up to eight keywords should immediately follow, with the keywords separated by commas and ending with a period. The body of the manuscript should be double-spaced and fully justified.

Keywords: image processing, morphology, binary morphology, partial volume, image quantification, 3D image processing, anisotropic imaging.
