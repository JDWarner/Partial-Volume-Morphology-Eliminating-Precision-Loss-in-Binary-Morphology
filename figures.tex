\section{Figures and Tables} 

%%-----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Figures} 

Figures are numbered in the order in which they are called out in the text. They should appear in the document in numerical order and as close as possible to their first reference in the text. It may be necessary to move figures or tables around to enhance readability. LaTeX will attempt to place figures at the top or bottom of a page in which they are first referenced.

Figures, along with their captions, should be separated from the main text by  0.2 in.\ or 5 mm and centered. Figure captions are centered below the figure or graph. Figure captions start with the abbreviation ``Fig" in front of the figure number, followed by a period, and the text in 10-pt. font. See Fig.~\ref{fig:example} for an example.
